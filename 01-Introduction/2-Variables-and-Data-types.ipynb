Variables also have types, which specify what type of data they can store (such as string and integer), and they can be used in expressions that use operators (such as `+` and `-`) to manipulate their values."

Typically, Booleans aren't used to perform mathematical operations; rather, they're used to make decisions and perform branching. Nevertheless, it's interesting to understand the relationship between types. Many types are nothing more than specialized versions of more general types.
