    "# Improving classification models\n",
    "\n",
    "In our exercises, we found that our model could predict avalanches so some degree, but it was still wrong around 40% of the time. This error amount is because our feature – the number of weak layers of snow – isn't the only thing that is responsible for avalanches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into the two primary ways to improve classification model performance: providing more features and being selective about what enters the model."

    "## Provide more features\n",
    "Like linear regression, logistic regression doesn't have to be limited to a single input. It can combine features to make predictions. For example, we might try to predict avalanches based on snow fall and number of hikers disturbing a trail. We can enter both of these features into the same model to calculate a probability of an avalanche.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, logistic regression combines features similarly to linear regression. That is, it treats all features as independent, meaning that it assumes that features don't influence one another. For example, our model assumes that the amount of snowfall doesn't change how many people visit the trail. By default, it also assumes that snowfall increases risk of avalanche by a set amount – regardless as to how many hikers are walking the trail."

    "## The good and bad sides of independent features\n",
    "Logistic regression can be explicitly told to combine features so that how they work together can be modeled, but won't by default. Making logistic regression different from most other well-known categorization algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that logistic regression treats features as independent by default is both a strength and a limitation that should be kept in mind. For example, it can make clear predictions simply, such as “increasing the number of people increases the risk”, which can't usually be done with other models. It also reduces the chance of overfitting the training data. By contrast, the model can fail to work well if features actually interact in the real-world. For example, five hikers crossing a mountain is risky if there's snow, but five people are safe if there's no snow-fall to cause an avalanche. A logistic regression model needs to be told explicitly to look for an interaction between snow-fall and number of hikers in this example to pick up this nuance."

    "## Think about your features\n",
    "The other way to improve models is to give real thought to which features are supplied, and why. Generally, the more features we add to a model, the better the model works. This correlation is only true, however, if the features we provide are relevant and explain something that existing features don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding overtraining\n",
    "If we supply more features that aren't useful, the model can overtrain. Giving the appearance of working better, but actually working worse in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine if we had daily records of the amount_of_snow, number_of_hikers, temperature, and number_of_birds_spotted. The number of birds spotted is probably not relevant information. Yet, if supplied the model ends up modeling a relationship between avalanches and the number of birds spotted on given days. If birds were spotted more on avalanche days, the model suggests birds could be responsible for causing avalanches. We might then set up a systematic bird watching program to predict avalanches, only to find it doesn't work at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding undertraining\n",
    "Using features naively can also lead to undertraining and not make predictions as correctly as possible. For example, the temperature and the number_of_hikers might both be closely linked to avalanches. Yet, if people only walk on sunny days, the model might find it difficult to differentiate how important hikers are in comparison to temperature. Similarly, we may find that our model works better if we supply our number_of_hikers as an exact count of visitors, rather than simply “high” or “low”. Then, let our model training find a more exact relationship."
