    "When you write code, one common challenge is to have it perform a task an unknown number of times. In this unit, you want to allow a user to enter a list of planet names. Unfortunately, you don't know how many names the user enters. To support looping an unknown number of times, you can use a `while` loop.\n",

    "A `while` loop performs an operation while a certain condition is true. You could use a while loop to:\n",

    "- Check for another line in a file.\n",

    "- Check if a user has finished entering values.\n",
    "- Check if something else has changed to indicate that the code can stop performing the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of a `while` loop is similar to that of an `if` statement. You provide both a condition and the code you want to run while the condition is true.\n",
