    "Functions are the next step after you've learned Python's programming basics. In its simplest form, a function contains code that always returns a value (or values). In some cases, a function also has optional or required inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start writing code that duplicates other parts of the program, it becomes a perfect opportunity to extract the code into a function. Although sharing common code through functions is useful, you can also limit the size of code by extracting parts out into smaller (more readable) functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs that avoid duplication and prevent large functions by using smaller functions are more readable and maintainable. They're also easier to debug when things aren't working right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several rules about function inputs are critical for you to fully take advantage of everything that functions have to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we're using the term input to describe what functions take in, these elements are usually called arguments or parameters. For consistency in this module, we'll refer to inputs as arguments."
